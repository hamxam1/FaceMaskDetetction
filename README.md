# FaceMaskDetetction


Face Mask Detection algorithm that sends email to desired person with datetime of when the mask was taken off. Added additional algorithm to send email when mask is off. The code is still a little buggy, when mask is off it pauses streaming to save photo in the chosen folder and sents email, loops this until mask is put back on. Don't forget to editt emails and modify to your own directory The bugs can easily be fixed and will be updated when I get the time to thread the functions together and put addition safe-guards.


Special Thanks to Kumar-ever :)
